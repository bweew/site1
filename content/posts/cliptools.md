- [smartclips for frontmatter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cliptools/id1619348240?mt=12)
- [keybind to create txt file on mac](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/129699/create-a-new-txt-file-in-finder-keyboard-shortcut)

using cliptools to write frontmatter for hugo blog posts is amazing. Beats doing "hugo new file.md" command in root directory. it was annoying to have to cd back and forth 3 directories over and over. I found it very disorienting.

That smartclips feature in cliptools is essential. hugo sorts your posts by date its critical that you get it in the right format its super tedious to type by hand and really hard to remember otherwise. its sooo good how it just plugs it in in the curly brackets.

## "coder theme" 
I kind of gave up on hugo for a while but i saw this nice minimal dark theme and its kind of perfect.
