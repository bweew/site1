# potrace
its a terminal app that takes bmp as input and exports eps
```
potrace bird.bmp -o bird.eps
``` 
# svgcode
this webapp uses wasm to run potrace in the browser
i found this shortly after potrace so i didn't stick around to learn all the cli options. but i like how under algorithm option: they have one called "turdsize" -t supress speckles of up to this size (default 2)
